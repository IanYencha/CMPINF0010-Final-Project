## Abstract
The objective of this project is to figure out which neighborhood is the enviornmentally helpful or, in other words, the most green. We all choose datasets that revolved around this objective; I did smart trash containers, Alek did green spaces, and Ian did tree amounts. At the end of this project, we wanted to see how each neighborhoods compare with each other in terms of these attributes, and whichever has the best balance of all three is deemeed the best place to live in Pittsburgh, as it is, atleast in comparison to our data, the most green neighborhood.
